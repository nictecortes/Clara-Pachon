          <p>
            When I began my journey along this path of connecting with light
            beings, I realized that angels do not come to predict the future or
            make decisions for us. They constantly try to communicate with us
            directly without violating the divine laws. As a result, today with
            gratitude I dedicate my life to spreading the messages that come
            from them.

          “QHHT is a powerful healing modality that combines hypnosis with the
          belief that we are all connected to a higher source of wisdom and
          healing. QHHT sessions can help to heal a wide range of physical,
          emotional, and spiritual issues, as well as gain insights into one’s
          life purpose and connect with one’s higher self.

        <p>
          Angelology therapy is a type of holistic healing that uses the power
          of angels to help people heal physically, emotionally, and
          spiritually. It is based on the belief that angels are always with us
          and willing to help us, if we only ask.

          It gives us a deeper understanding of the spiritual world and our
          place in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can learn how to connect with our angels and receive their guidance
          and support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing that we are surrounded by angels who love and support us can
          bring us a great sense of hope and peace. We can trust that our angels
          are always with us, even when we are going through difficult times.

        <p>
          Energy Healing is a holistic practice that recognizes the connection
          between the physical body, mind, emotions, and spirit. It operates on
          the fundamental belief that our bodies are comprised of energy, and
          imbalances or blockages in this energy can lead to physical,
          emotional, or spiritual dis-ease. Energy Healing seeks to restore
          harmony and vitality by clearing these blockages and promoting the
          free flow of energy.
