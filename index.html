          <p>
            When I began my journey along this path of connecting with light
            beings, I realized that angels do not come to predict the future or
            make decisions for us. They are constantly trying to communicate
            with us directly without violating the divine laws. As a result,
            today with gratitude I dedicate my life to spreading the messages
            that come from them.

              Energy Healing is a holistic practice that recognizes the
              connection between the physical body, mind, emotions, and spirit.
              It operates on the fundamental belief that our bodies are
              comprised of energy, and imbalances or blockages in this energy
              can lead to physical, emotional, or spiritual dis-ease. Energy
              Healing seeks to restore harmony and vitality by clearing these
              blockages and promoting the free flow of energy.
